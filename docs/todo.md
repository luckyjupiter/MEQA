TODO list

## Completed Features

### ✅ Dynamic Recalibration with Stability Controls
- Implemented hysteresis mechanism for recalibration to prevent oscillations
- Added time-based locking to ensure stability over long sessions
- Created continuous monitoring of entropy source characteristics
- Added detailed logging of recalibration events
- Enhanced WilberRWBA class to support dynamic bound updates

### ✅ Adaptive Bayesian Updating System
- Implemented rolling hit rate tracking in WilberRWBA class for real-time adaptation
- Added multi-hypothesis support beyond yes/no questions
- Implemented time-to-bound weighting for stronger/weaker evidence scaling
- Added stability thresholds to prevent oscillation in belief states
- Created confidence calculation based on statistical properties of hit rates

### ✅ Confidence Thresholds with Session Extension
- Added "No Decision" state when evidence is insufficient
- Implemented automatic session extension for ambiguous results
- Added configurable confidence and decision margin thresholds
- Created decision state classification (confident, tentative, insufficient)
- Added detailed logging of session extension process

### ✅ Optimized Bound Size for Different Predictability Regimes in RWBA
- Implemented regime-specific bound size scaling based on Wilber's research
- Added specialized formulas for different predictability ranges:
  - Near-random inputs (p ≈ 0.5): n ≈ 1/(2p-1)² with large bounds (101-300)
  - Moderate bias (0.52 < p < 0.55): n ≈ 1/(2p-1) with medium bounds (31-50)
  - Strong bias (p > 0.55): n ≈ 1/√(2p-1) with small bounds (15-30)
- Added configurable toggle for regime-adaptive bound optimization
- Enhanced recalibration to consider predictability regimes for optimal statistical efficiency
- Integrated detailed metrics and logging of regime transitions

### ✅ Surprisal-Based Weighting for Adaptive Bound Selection
- Implemented real-time surprisal calculation based on empirical CDF of steps-to-bound
- Added dynamic bound size adjustment based on statistical rarity of observed results:
  - High surprisal (> 4 bits): Increase bound size to enhance sensitivity
  - Moderate surprisal (2-4 bits): Maintain current bound size
  - Low surprisal (< 2 bits): Decrease bound size for faster decisions
- Implemented smoothing factor to prevent oscillations in bound size
- Added empirical and theoretical CDF models for surprisal calculation
- Integrated with existing regime-based bound selection for optimal performance
- Added tracking and logging of surprisal metrics for system analysis

## XOR Preprocessing Optimization

1. Benchmark XOR preprocessing effects on overall system performance:
   - Implement A/B testing framework to compare XOR-enabled vs. XOR-disabled trials
   - Collect metrics on effect size, statistical significance, and response accuracy
   - Create visualization tools to analyze the differences

2. Implement adaptive XOR processing:
   - Develop real-time tracking mechanism to monitor effect size with/without XOR
   - Create toggle system to automatically disable XOR if mind-matter effect size decreases
   - Add configuration options for sensitivity threshold and sampling frequency

3. Documentation updates:
   - Document the theoretical tradeoffs between classical bias reduction and mind-matter sensitivity
   - Include Wilber's cautions about preprocessing effects on mind-matter interactions
   - Create decision matrix for when to use/not use XOR preprocessing

4. Validation methodology:
   - Design experiments to validate effect size differences across various question types
   - Implement statistical analysis tools to quantify the impact of XOR preprocessing
   - Create reporting framework for long-term tracking of system performance
